_In/visible messages are embedded in the non/perceptible parts of the media file_

One way to efficiently include information in a media file is by embedding digital signatures, certificates, or other data as visible or hidden messages using watermarking and steganography. These technologies have been in existence for centuries and are reliable for all media types, as they secure the file and its embedded metadata from tampering.

However, a downside is that they create dependencies on often proprietary and costly technology. They also rely on the users having access to the same software used to embed the hidden message initially.
