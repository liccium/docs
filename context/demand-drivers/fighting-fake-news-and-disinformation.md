# Fighting fake news and disinformation

Fake news and disinformation can cause harm and confusion to individuals and society by spreading misinformation and deceit. They also have the potential to erode trust in information sources, institutions, and democratic processes. Due to the emergence of generative AI and the ease of sharing information online or on social media, the problem is expanding rapidly.

When digital media content is published and shared online, for users it is often hard to identify the original source, to verify the integrity of the content, and to find out whether content has been altered or maliciously manipulated. Proper content identification, attribution, and the availability of rights management information are fundamental prerequisites to tackle fake news and misinformation.
