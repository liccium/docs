AI-generated content poses an emerging challenge and threat for creators and rightsholders as it potentially blurs the lines between what is considered original and what is AI-generated. As machine generated content is not protected by copyright under current legal regimes, unclear ownership and attribution is an essential topic in the development of the technology.

The unauthorised use of copyrighted works contained in training data is problematic in itself. It may cause illegal replications of existing works, which could lead to accusations of infringement or plagiarism. In cases where an AI model trained on a dataset of existing paintings may generate a new painting that represents an edited version but that resembles a pre-existing work, leading to questions about originality and ownership.

Declaring original creative works and attributing them to a creative human could help to distinguish it from AI-generated content.
