# Market centralisation

Business models of media organisations in all sectors are at stake due to the lack of efficiency of the digital media markets whilst working in an environment of concentration of power by large and centralised intermediaries, retailers, and platforms.

Private and commercial users love to publish and share images, videos and opinions on websites, blogs and on social media. But even though the internet itself is decentralised, in the so-called ‘web2’ environment only a limited number of popular applications benefit from the commercial value of the content generated by creative individuals and other users. Only a few centralised retailers and platforms control the terms, supply and demand, access to content, user accounts, data, and communication, which can result in imposing unfair conditions on businesses and end users.

Many media sectors, especially digital book publishing, the music industry, and video distribution experience a degree of centralisation of power which is no longer feasible for them in commercial and strategic terms. Cultural and creative diversity is at stake.
