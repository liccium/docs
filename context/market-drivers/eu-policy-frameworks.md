# EU policy frameworks

Policymakers in collaboration with media organisations in many parts of the world are seeking to tackle the current media crisis and to fight disinformation and fake news.

New European legislation on media, copyright, and e-commerce, in particular the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (DSM), the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) enforce increased transparency and greater accountability for content which is published online and on the digital marketplaces by users and rightsholders. They also aim at reducing the harm caused by oligopolistic gatekeepers and their business behaviour, terms and conditions, ensuring the openness of important digital services. These policy developments will not only increase trust and transparency for the markets, but also create business opportunities for established creators and rightsholders as well as new market entrants and start-ups.
