# Web3

In this precarious context, decentralised applications have the potential to diminish the dominance of centralised gatekeepers and strengthen competition in the media markets.

Decentralised web3 and blockchain technology can empower distributed trust in content declarations, authenticity, attribution, and metadata. NFTs, or tokenization, in general, can potentially support the emergence of decentralised marketplaces that will support a broad discoverability of the assets by curating, bundling, filtering, selecting, and presenting goods and items. Decentralised applications on open blockchain networks allow the creative communities and users to interact directly and securely through accounts they fully control on the platforms they choose.
