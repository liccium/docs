# Verifiable Creator Credentials

Since anyone can make a public declaration, it is important to ensure proper authentication of the source of each declaration. Liccium declaration metadata contain publicly accessible and verifiable creator credentials, which are based on the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials, supported by advanced and qualified certificates that properly identify creators and rightsholders (according to the novel eIDAS regulation). Creator credentials serve as a means for attribution and authentication of creators and rightsholders based on social or institutional authentication, thereby increasing trust in claims and attribution.

### 1. Decentralized Digital Identity (SSI)

Creators can independently manage identities and credentials without depending on centralised authorities, maintaining full control over their claims.

### 2. Cryptographically Verifiable Claims

Credentials are cryptographically secured, ensuring authenticity, integrity, and tamper resistance, enabling reliable, permanent attribution—even pseudonymously if desired.

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Attribution

Creators can prove ownership or authorship claims without compromising their personal privacy, maintaining control over how their identity and attribution information is shared.

## Motivation

Creator Credentials introduces decentralised digital identities to the cultural and creative industries. Why? Because we see many use cases for VCs and DIDs in the media industries that can help to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of online media environments.

The abundance and widespread dissemination of media content online poses significant challenges for users in terms of analysing and verifying the data integrity, authenticity, claims and attribution to the content. This lack of transparency creates an environment that fosters the spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns.

Proper attribution, using tools and services based on the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), can potentially improve the situation. However, the concepts of SSI are mostly unknown to the creative communities. SSI tools and protocols are not easy to use, and the barriers of entry are simply too high to get the media sector interested and involved.

## Project Goals <a href="#project-goals" id="project-goals"></a>

Creator Credentials has developed a user-centric digital identity management framework that is specifically designed to serve the unique needs of the cultural and creative industries.

This includes a software application that can be used by media organisations, membership organisations or other trust services to manage and issue verifiable credentials to creators and other rightsholders. Creator Credentials increases the trustworthiness of declarations and claims to digital media content online.

Creator Credentials aims to establish a new role for public entities and organisations in digital media publishing. By extending the state-of-the-art in digital identities to the cultural and creative communities and solving existing real-world problems, the project aims to provide new and highly innovative software solutions for credential issuers and future trust services.

In 2023, the European Union funded a project called 'Creator Credentials' as one selected project of the NGI's Trustchain consortium under grant agreement Nr. 101093274.&#x20;

The Creator Credentials project developed a user-centric digital identity management framework specifically designed for the cultural and creative communities. This includes a software application that can be used by media organisations to issue verifiable credentials to creators and other rightsholders. Creator Credentials will increase the trustworthiness of declarations and claims to digital media content online.

Feel free to have a look at the visual interface of the Creator Credentials app:

Be aware that the application is still in development. Not all things be fully functional, but you can certainly click through the application and get a better idea what you can do either as a creator or as a trust service (credentials issuer).
