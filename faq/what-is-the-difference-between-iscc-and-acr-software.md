# What is the difference between ISCC and ACR software?

The ISCC makes use of technologies related to ACR (automatic content recognition technologies) to come up with a new short and generic standard identifier for digital content – but ISCC is not an ACR. The following table provides a comparison between the ISCC system and ACR technology.

| An open identifier standard proposal                                                                                        | Based on proprietary software                                                                                                    |
| Creates a short identifier string, generated by a combination of multiple fingerprints and cryptographic hashing algorithms | Not an identifier but a content identification system, working with large and granular fingerprints and special indexing systems |
| Can be generated by anyone with access to content for all media types and formats                                           | Often optimised for specific media types                                                                                         |
| Has near duplicate content-matching capabilities (lightweight fingerprints)                                                 | Developed for content matching, can analyse and compare assets and small chunks in great detail                                  |
| Can be easily implemented in existing applications, which ensures interoperability across entities                          | Detailed fingerprints not interoperable                                                                                          |
