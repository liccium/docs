# What is the difference between ISCC and ACR software?

The ISCC makes use of technologies related to ACR (automatic content recognition technologies) to come up with a new short and generic standard identifier for digital content â€“ but ISCC is not an ACR. The following table provides a comparison between the ISCC system and ACR technology.

| ISCC                                                                                                                                                   | ACR                                                                                                     |

| ISCC is an open standard proposal                                                                                                                      | ACRS are mostly complex services \ operated with proprietary software                                   |
| ISCC creates a short \ identifier string                                                                                                               | ACRS do not provide a short, \ public identifier string                                                 |
| ISCC can identify digital assets \ in all media formats                                                                                                | ACRS is not an identifier \ but an identification system                                                |
| ISCC is generated by a combination of multiple fingerprints and cryptographic hashing algorithms                                                       | ACRS works with large and granular fingerprints and special indexing systems                            |
| ISCC has near duplicate content-matching capabilities (lightweight fingerprints)                                                                       | ACRS is developed for content matching, \ can match and compare assets and small chunks in great detail |
| ISCC cannot analyse content in detail                                                                                                                  | ACRS can compare assets and \ small chunks in great detail                                              |
| A short identifier string can be stored \ in databases or on blockchains \ very efficiently                                                            | ACRS are complex systems that requires database indexing technologies and large storage capacities      |
| The ISCC is optimised for the use \ on blockchains                                                                                                     | It is not possible to easily store and \ openly provide large fingerprints                              |
| ISCC can easily be implemented \ in existing applications and services                                                                                 | Most ACRS depend on external services \ and cannot easily be implemented \ in existing applications     |
| ISCC ensures interoperability of content-related processes across creators, intermediaries, retailers and other organisations, systems or repositories | Fingerprints are not interoperable                                                                      |
| A short identifier string allows for \ automated machine-to-machine communication and transactions                                                     | ACRS do not provide a short fingerprint-based identifier                                                |
| ISCC can be created by anyone \ with access to the content file                                                                                        | ACRS often requires using proprietary software and indexing/matching services                           |
| ISCC can be used for \ all media content types                                                                                                         | ACRS are often optimised \ for specific media types                                                     |
