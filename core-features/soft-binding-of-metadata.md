# Soft Binding of Metadata

Soft binding technology securely links rights and metadata to digital content without embedding them directly into the media file itself. Instead, metadata and rights declarations are stored externally and cryptographically bound to the content using ISCC codes. This ensures that rights and metadata remain discoverable, accessible, and verifiable independently of the original file, even after transformations such as format conversions, compression, or editing.

Key advantages of Soft Binding include:

### Metadata Resilience:

Metadata and rights declarations remain intact and verifiable, even if the original content file is modified or metadata is removed.

### Scalable Rights Management:

Enables automated, large-scale management of rights declarations, licensing terms, and metadata across entire industries or platforms.

### Flexible Metadata Integration:

Supports integration of industry-specific or custom metadata through modular plugins, allowing tailored rights management solutions for diverse sectors and content types.
