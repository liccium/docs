# ISCC Content Fingerprinting

The International Standard Content Code (ISCC) is a content-derived identifier that uniquely represents digital media assets, including texts, images, videos, and audio files. Unlike traditional identifiers (ISBN, ISRC, DOI), ISCC codes are generated algorithmically directly from the content itself, requiring no centralized registration or manual assignment.

ISCC uses advanced cryptographic and perceptual hashing to detect exact matches and near-duplicates, making it a powerful tool for tracking content distribution, provenance, and authenticity across platforms and formats.

Key properties of ISCC fingerprinting include:

### Integrity Verification:

Cryptographic hashes detect even minor alterations, ensuring content integrity.

### Similarity Matching:

Similarity-preserving hashes (SimHashes) identify near-duplicate files, enabling tracking across content transformations.

### Universal Application:

ISCC facilitates consistent metadata management, rights tracking, and reliable content authentication, serving as a universal reference point for digital media, fostering interoperability and persistent linking of claims and content across creative industries.
