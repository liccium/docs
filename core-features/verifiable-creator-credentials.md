# Verifiable Creator Credentials

Liccium integrates the Creator Credentials protocol, enabling creators and rightsholders to manage, host, and use publicly accessible, cryptographically secured digital credentials following the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard.&#x20;

This ensures that content declarations and rights claims can always be clearly and independently linked to the identities of creators and rightsholders, supporting reliable proof of authorship and ownership. By using Creator Credentials, Liccium significantly strengthens trust and accountability in digital media by enabling proper, secure, and persistent attribution of content – even pseudonymously – across platforms and use cases.

Key advantages of Verifiable Credentials include:

### Decentralized Digital Identity (SSI)

Creators can independently manage identities and credentials without depending on centralized authorities, maintaining full control over their claims.

### Cryptographically Verifiable Claims

Credentials are cryptographically secured, ensuring authenticity, integrity, and tamper resistance, enabling reliable, permanent attribution—even pseudonymously if desired.

### Privacy-Preserving Attribution

Creators can prove ownership or authorship claims without compromising their personal privacy, maintaining control over how their identity and attribution information is shared.
