# Federated Content Registries

Liccium employs a decentralized network of multiple federated registries for securely storing and managing digital content declarations. These registries function like distributed directories, hosting metadata about content and rights declarations, rather than storing the digital media itself. Stakeholders can independently operate their own registries, which seamlessly interoperate to form a unified, globally accessible ecosystem for verifying digital content claims.

Key advantages include:

### Decentralized Directory Infrastructure:

Registries provide open, interoperable directories of rights declarations and metadata, ensuring transparent verification without relying on centralized control or proprietary databases.

### Effective Registry Synchronization:

Licciumâ€™s federated approach enables efficient synchronization across multiple registries. Third parties can quickly and easily access a vast number of content declarations by referencing a simple ISCC code, greatly simplifying rights verification and content authentication processes.

### Flexible Access and Control:

Organizations can tailor access permissions, defining who may create, modify, or query declarations, allowing industry-specific governance and compliance flexibility.

### Scalable Real-Time Performance:

Efficiently handles billions of ISCC declarations and metadata records, facilitating rapid and reliable verification of digital content at scale, essential for platforms, AI developers, and rights enforcement entities.
