# On-chain data

Another privacy concern must address the question, in which place metadata or credentials that may or may not contain personal information are stored. In general, ISCC declarations do not publish and store any personal data in smart contracts on-chain. Declarers may optionally reference off-chain metadata related to their content registration. Applications that implement ISCC declarations are advised to inform users about any privacy related matters specific to their application.
