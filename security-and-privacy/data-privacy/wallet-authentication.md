# Wallet authentication

The Liccium app is designed as a browser-based application, which will allow users to sign in with their cryptographic wallet.

Sign-up/sign-in with a cryptographic wallet, also known as “Sign-in with Ethereum,” is a way for users to authenticate themselves to a website or application using a digital wallet and their private keys, rather than using a traditional username and password.

This improves privacy and data protection in several ways. First, as the user’s private key is used to authenticate their identity, the website or application needs no personal information such as a username or e-mail address on their servers. This reduces the risk of data breaches and prevents leakage of personal information.

Second, because the private key is stored on the user's device, rather than on the website or application server, hampers theft or access to the user's username and password, which can protect their identity and assets.

Third, when a private key is used, the information being sent and received is encrypted from end to end, which increases security and privacy. Additionally, the private key can be used to sign transactions on the blockchain, resulting in even more control of user data.

Overall, the use of cryptographic wallets for authentication can be seen as a more secure and privacy-preserving alternative to traditional username and password-based authentication methods. It shifts the control and responsibility of identity management into the user’s sphere and under the user’s own control which is a more privacy-friendly way of signing procedures.
