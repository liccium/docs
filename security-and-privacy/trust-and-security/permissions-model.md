# Permissions model

The Liccium app will implement a permissions model that allows certain features and actions depending on the user's level of verification.

Users not authenticated yet can generate and search for ISCC codes, while those who log in with their MetaMask wallet can make basic declarations. Social verification is required for higher level declarations to appear as “socially verified,” and domain authentication is required for declarations to appear as “verified.”

Additional rights and metadata can be provided by verified accounts or users that can present verifiable credentials from trusted VC issuers.
