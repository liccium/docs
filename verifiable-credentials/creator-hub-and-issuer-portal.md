The app is based on decentralised identifiers (DIDs), and verifiable credentials (VCs). It will be aligned with European regulations on digital identity and data privacy, ensuring that all credentials issued and verified adhere to industry regulations and safeguard self-sovereign control over user data.

The app is developed as an open-sourced, dockerised service that can be installed on premise by media organisations. It will facilitate the onboarding process, mutual authentication, and verification of credential issuers and creators. The app will support the creation and issuance of a variety of credential types and subjects, tailored to the specific needs of the various media sectors.

Be aware that the application is still in development. Not all things be fully functional, but you can certainly click through the application and get a better idea what you can do either as a creator or as a trust service (credentials issuer).
