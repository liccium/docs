# Third party endorsements

In addition to self-issued credentials via social and domain verification, the Liccium app will also allow creators to receive and use VCs, which have been issued from 3rd-party organisations acting as VC issuers or trust services.

These trust services can provide users with VCs for various credential types and subjects. The trustworthiness of these credentials is based on the reputation of the issuing institution and qualified or advanced certificates of the trust service.&#x20;

Third party endorsements or creator credentials will significantly increase the trustworthiness of creator's and rightsholder's content declarations and claims.
