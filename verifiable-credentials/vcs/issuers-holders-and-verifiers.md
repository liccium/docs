In the context of the cultural and creative industries, any organisation or institution could potentially be an issuer of verifiable credentials and act as a trust service for attribution or assertions. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The [CreatorCredentials.cc](https://trustchain.ngi.eu/creatorcredentials-cc/) project will build a software application that can be used by media organisations to issue verifiable credentials to creators and other rightsholders, establishing a new role for public entities and organisations in digital media publishing to act as credential issuers and trust services.
{% endhint %}

### Credential issuers

Let’s have a look at a few examples of credential issuers:

* A membership organisation could issue VCs to their members;
* A CMO could issue VCs to creators they represent;
* A publisher or media organisation could attest attribution of authors, photographers, and freelancers;
* Any publicly known entity could issue VCs based on qualified certificates that were already issued to them.

### Credential holders

Verifiable credentials have the potential to provide sufficient identification about the holders as the parties making content declarations, such as:

* Creators, i.e., writers, bloggers, photographers, journalists, musicians, etc.;
* Rightsholders, i.e., publishers, labels, intermediaries, retailers.

### Credential verifiers

Verifier of VCs could be:

* Any user who wishes to authenticate the content declaration;
* A platform, such as an Online Content-Sharing Service Provider (OCSSP);
* Retailers and shops that require domain-specific identity confirmation or want to verify claims to content or attribution.
