# VCs

To create trust in otherwise permissionless content declarations, claims and attribution, the primary ISCC declaration metadata will contain links to publicly accessible and verifiable credentials (VCs). These can serve as means for attestation and authentication of creators and rightsholders based on social or institutional authentication. VCs will further reduce illegitimate or unlicensed use or misappropriation of creative content.
