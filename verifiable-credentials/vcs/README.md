# Creator Credentials (VCs)

To create trust in otherwise permissionless content declarations, claims and attribution, the primary ISCC declaration metadata will contain links to publicly accessible and verifiable creator credentials (VCs).&#x20;

Creator Credentials serve as means for attestation and authentication of creators and rightsholders based on social or institutional authentication. VCs will further reduce illegitimate or unlicensed use or misappropriation of creative content.

Creator credentials represent a revolutionary advancement in the realm of digital identity and authentication. These self-sovereign credentials empower creators and rightsholders with unprecedented control and flexibility over their own information. In this context, VCs offer a multitude of essential features that not only enhance security but also facilitate seamless interoperability across various systems and applications. Let's delve into the key attributes that make Verified Credentials a game-changer in the digital landscape:

VCs offer a multitude of essential features and benefits that not only enhance security but also facilitate seamless interoperability across various systems and applications. Let's delve into the key attributes that make Verified Credentials a game-changer for digital authentication:

1. Creator Credentials are **self-sovereign**, which means that creators and rightsholders have primary ownership and control over their credentials. They can choose where to host, when to use, and how to share them, including controlling access levels and revoking access if needed.
2. Creator Credentials are **portable**, which means that once issued the holder can transfer credentials between different systems and platforms without loss of information or functionality. They can also be used with various applications or services as required.
3. Creator Credentials are **interoperable**, which means that credentials issued by one system can be recognised and accepted by other systems, even if they are built on different technologies or operated by different organisations. Third party applications can independently verify these credentials.
4. Creator Credentials  can also be **restricted in duration**. This means they support the ability to set expiration dates for verifiable credentials, defining a time limit on how long a verifiable credential is valid. Limited validity can be useful for credentials that expire, such as professional licence or certifications.
5. Creator Credentials  are **revocable**, which means that they can be revoked or cancelled in cases of expiration or other reasons. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the credential system and ensuring that only valid and accurate information is being shared. The revocation can be initiated by the issuer of the credential or by the individual or entity who holds the credential. It can be enforced by the systems that recognise and accept the credential.
6. Creator Credentials are **cryptographically verifiable**, which is essential for the proper attribution of rights, permissions, and restrictions, ensuring transparency and accountability.
7. Creator Credentials are **resilient**. Using them in the context of ISCC declarations, even in cases of content alteration, manipulation, or removal of watermarks or metadata, Creator Credentials can still be derived from the content and its associated ISCC code.
8. Creator Credentials are **publicly accessible**, allowing for verification within the context of any public content declaration or claim.
9. Creator Credentials are **immutable and trustworthy**, meaning they cannot be altered without detection or notice.
10. Creator Credentials are **timestamped** to ensure cryptographic verifiability and transparency and to provide information about who made a declaration and when it was made, both for humans and machines.

In 2023, the European Union funded a project called 'Creator Credentials' as one selected project of the NGI's Trustchain consortium under grant agreement Nr. 101093274.&#x20;

The Creator Credentials project will develop a user-centric digital identity management framework specifically designed for the cultural and creative communities. This includes a software application that can be used by media organisations to issue verifiable credentials to creators and other rightsholders. Creator Credentials will increase the trustworthiness of declarations and claims to digital media content online.
