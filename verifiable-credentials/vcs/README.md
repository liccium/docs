# Creator Credentials (VCs)

To create trust in otherwise permissionless content declarations, claims and attribution, the primary ISCC declaration metadata will contain links to publicly accessible and verifiable creator credentials (VCs). These can serve as means for attestation and authentication of creators and rightsholders based on social or institutional authentication. VCs will further reduce illegitimate or unlicensed use or misappropriation of creative content.

In 2023, the European Union funded a project called [CreatorCredentials.cc](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/Q24Y4feVWHWWf6v1gexc/) as one selected project of the NGI's Trustchain consortium under grant agreement Nr. 101093274.&#x20;

CreatorCredentials.cc will develop a user-centric digital identity management framework specifically designed for the cultural and creative communities. This includes a software application that can be used by media organisations to issue verifiable credentials to creators and other rightsholders. Creator Credentials will increase the trustworthiness of declarations and claims to digital media content online.
