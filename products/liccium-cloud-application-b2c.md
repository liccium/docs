# Liccium Cloud Application (B2C)

The Liccium Cloud Application empowers individual creators and rightsholders – such as photographers, writers, musicians, and videographers – to digitally sign their works, register metadata, and publicly declare rights in a secure, intuitive, and verifiable manner. Creators can easily:

* Certify ownership and attribution for their original content.
* Manage metadata and licensing terms securely and intuitively.
* Protect their content with persistent, verifiable rights declarations.
