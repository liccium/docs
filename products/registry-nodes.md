# Registry Nodes

Liccium’s technology enables third parties to independently set up and operate their own registry nodes within Liccium’s decentralized federated registry infrastructure. This flexible solution serves two key purposes:

## Declaration Registries:

Media organizations, membership organizations, or platforms can independently host and manage their own registries to store digital content declarations and rights metadata securely and reliably.

## Verification Registries:

Organizations can set up verification nodes to synchronize and access large volumes of rights declaration metadata, enabling rapid, real-time verification of digital media content across decentralized networks.

This federated registry approach ensures:

### Effective Registry Synchronisation:

Efficient synchronization and interoperability across federated registries, enabling third parties to easily and reliably access extensive declaration data.

### Flexible, Sector-specific Control:

Organizations can manage and define tailored governance rules, access permissions, and metadata structures, providing customized solutions aligned with specific industry requirements.

### Scalable Content Authentication:

Supports large-scale deployment and real-time querying, ensuring rapid and secure verification of content provenance and compliance with declared rights and licenses.
