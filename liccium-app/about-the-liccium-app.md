# About the Liccium app

In 2022, Posth Werk was awarded funding through the [Trublo.eu grant program](https://www.trublo.eu/verisimpledc/) from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 957228.&#x20;

Our objective was to define a protocol and develop a user-friendly application that enables the declaration of content ownership, metadata, and rights management information based on the upcoming [ISCC](https://iscc.codes) standard for decentralised digital content identification.

To enhance credibility and establish trust in content assertions, we aimed to introduce publicly accessible, verifiable credentials to the media sectors that can identify creators and rightsholders based on social or institutional authentication.

Thanks to the grant, we could initiate the development of the Liccium app. While the app is still in its early stages, we welcome early feedback to ensure that it meets the expectations of creators and rightsholders.

We are excited to announce that the MVP of the app is now ready for testing. We invite individual users to participate in the MVP and provide feedback on its features, requirements, and terms of service.
