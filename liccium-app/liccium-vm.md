# Liccium VM

The Liccium VM (Virtual Machine) will enable media organisations to run the Liccium application on their own servers or local network. This additional service would offer greater control, security, and efficiency for processing large amounts of media assets, without the need to upload content to the cloud.

In order to use the Liccium VM, media organisations would need to install the Liccium application on their servers or network and configure it to run within the virtual environment provided by the VM. The VM would provide the necessary resources, including processing power, memory, and storage, for the application to run.

The Liccium VM also allows media organisations to customise the Liccium application to ideally suit their specific needs and integrate seamlessly with their existing workflows and systems. This approach would provide a flexible and scalable solution for verifying content and metadata, while maintaining the media assets and data under a companyâ€™s own control and within its own infrastructure.
