# Liccium Features

Using the Liccium app (even as an MVP as yet) lets content creators generate content-derived identifiers from the digital media assets of their original creative works already. Users can edit the name and description of the entries, provide basic metadata, and links to licences, storefronts, or other websites.

In the current implementation, users can select the Twitter verification and the domain verification method to receive a verifiable credential (VCs) that will be linked to the declaration metadata to increase trust and transparency for their claims and declarations.

Based on these steps, users can digitally sign their declarations to ensure trust and transparency in the authenticity and integrity of content and metadata.
