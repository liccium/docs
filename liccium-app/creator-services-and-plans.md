# Creator services and plans

The goal of Liccium app is to promote the widespread adoption of digitally signing and declaring content-derived ISCC codes on public blockchain networks. This includes inseparably binding rights management information and other metadata, as well as publicly accessible, verifiable credentials to the identifiers. By doing so, Liccium strives to enhance trust and transparency in claims and attestations of content declaration.

Liccium's business model is based on offering a range of plans, including free and premium plans, to meet the needs of creators and rightsholders. Liccium aims to minimise barriers to entry, highlighting our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity.

The basic free plan allows users to make simple non-custodial declarations using the wallets they control. These transactions shall be possible for little to zero costs, depending on the transaction fees of the selected blockchain network.&#x20;

As blockchain ecosystems evolve, we anticipate the emergence of numerous zkEVM blockchains that utilise zero-knowledge proofs to enable off-chain computation of smart contracts, while maintaining the security and trustlessness of the Ethereum mainnet. This development will significantly reduce the computational load on the Ethereum blockchain, enable higher transaction throughput and lower fees compared to traditional EVM-based blockchains.

Since it is not mandatory to store the digital media assets after a completed transaction, the free plan will always allow for simple declarations. However, for creators and rightsholders who require storage and pinning services for their digital media assets and metadata, Liccium offers Premium, Pro, and Enterprise plans, depending on the user's needs.

A mix of Basic and Premium plugins will support the integration of plugins by 3rd-parties and declare use-case- or industry-specific rights and metadata, enhancing the app's generic functionality for both creators and rightsholders.

To make non-custodial declarations more accessible for users who are inexperienced in web3 and cryptocurrencies, Liccium will offer Premium and Pro plans that will provide customers with the ability to sign declaration transactions on public blockchain networks without the need to hold or pay for transaction fees in the native cryptocurrencies of the chosen blockchains. Non-custodial declarations are more convenient for users of the Liccium platform.

The Pro plan addresses professional creators requiring advanced features to manage their digital content and declarations. It offers all features of the Premium plan, along with custodial and bulk declarations, additionally, the option to maintain multiple user accounts, and media hosting and pinning in high resolution.

While bulk declarations offer more convenience and the use of multiple accounts will increase the security, Liccium's custodial declaration system streamlines the declaration process by enabling users to sign transactions using a wallet controlled by the Liccium service. This eliminates the need for users to set up and manage their own wallets, simplifying the declaration of content.&#x20;

However, the platform also recognises the importance of content portability, allowing users to maintain control over their content declarations even if they choose to leave the service. With the ability to transfer their custodial declarations to a non-custodial wallet, users can retain ownership of their entries, codes, metadata, and credentials, and easily migrate to any different platform or service while still maintaining control over their declarations. This feature underscores Liccium's commitment to convenience and ease of use while at the same time providing users with flexibility and control over their content declarations.
