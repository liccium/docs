# Liccium plugins

Liccium plugins enable the integration of use-case- or industry-specific metadata to declarations. These plugins enhance the app's generic functionality for creators and rightsholders. For instance, photographers and photojournalists currently use the IPTC standards to attach technical, descriptive, and administrative metadata or copyright information to their images.

With Liccium they can seamlessly embed metadata and bind external metadata to their content, thereby customising the app to their specific needs. By offering plugins that cater to these specific requirements, Liccium can foster an ecosystem that boosts the platform's utility for creators and rightsholders.
