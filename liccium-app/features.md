Using the Liccium app lets content creators generate content-derived identifiers from the digital media assets of their original creative works. Users can edit metadata of their entries and provide links to licences, storefronts, or other websites.

In the current implementation, users can select the Twitter verification and the domain verification method to receive a verifiable credential (VCs) that will be linked to the declaration metadata to increase trust and transparency for their claims and declarations.

Based on these steps, users can digitally sign their declarations to ensure trust and transparency in the authenticity and integrity of content and metadata.

## **Generating ISCCs**

Liccium allows users to generate and manage content-derived identifiers from the following media types and formats:

```

doc, docx, xls, xlsx, pptx, epub, mobi, ibooks,

## **Binding metadata**

Liccium allows users to inseparably bind product metadata, links to rights and licences, and other claims to the content.

## Providing credentials

Liccium allows the generation of verifiable credentials (VCs), inseparably connecting them to the declarations.

## Declaring content

Liccium allows the declaration of ISCC codes on public blockchain networks, i.e., Ethereum, Polygon, etc.
