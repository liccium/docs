# Additional features

In the coming sprints we will also include the following new features to the Liccium app:

* Additional verification methods will offer higher levels of trust (e.g., GitHub verification);
* Filters and folders will allow users to better manage their media entries, collections, and metadata;
* For testing purposes, at this moment the users of the MVP of the Liccium app can only make declarations on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. We will include the Polygon Mumbai testnet;
* With the go-live of the application we will add the Ethereum and Polygon main networks to the list of available blockchain networks;
* At that time, users will also be able to pay for the services via different subscription plans and services with a debit/credit card in FIAT currencies. This will simplify user onboarding to a great deal.
