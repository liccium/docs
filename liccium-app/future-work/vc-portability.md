# VC portability

Furthermore, Liccium will allow users to manage their credentials, download them and upload VCs to any app having been issued by trusted 3rd party issuer services.

VCs are meant to be portable, interoperable, and self-hosted. This means that it should be possible to utilise VCs issued by one issuer service and take them to a third-party application that can utilise the VCs within their own application, while the VC owner retains control over the VCs and the choice of which party to present which credential.
