# Decentralised web nodes (DWNs)

Liccium will also investigate the use of decentralised web nodes (DWN) as a solution to host and provide access to VCs to other users, platforms, and machines.

Decentralised Web Nodes (DWN) are a type of peer-to-peer network nodes used to power a decentralised web. These nodes can be run by anyone anywhere and they are responsible for storing, indexing, and serving web content, data, and applications in a distributed manner.

DWNs serve as a personal data storage and message relay mechanism that can be used to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given DID or VC. These nodes also propose a query language whereby a DID can make VCs searchable by schema, e.g., “has this DID published credentials of the type 'ISCCDeclaration2022' containing content tag X?”

DWNs aim to provide a more open, resilient, and censorship-resistant web by replacing traditional centralised infrastructure with a network of independent nodes that can work in conjunction to provide web services.

DWNs are a critical part of such infrastructure and are typically based on distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, peer-to-peer protocols, and content-addressable storage solutions.

Decentralised, persistent peer-to-peer hosting solutions, like IPFS or Arweave, make content and metadata immutable, meaning it cannot be taken down if only one user pins it. This may raise concerns about data privacy. DWN's innovative contribution to the problem is that users have control of their data while at the same time utilising the content addressing feature like IPFS or Arweave.

DECENTRALIZED WEB NODE

"Most digital activities between people, organizations, devices, and other entities require the exchange of messages and data. For entities to exchange messages and data for credential, app, or service flows, they need an interface through which to store, discover, and fetch data related to the flows and experiences they are participating in. A Decentralized Web Node (DWN) is a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given Decentralized Identifier (DID). Decentralized Web Nodes are a mesh-like datastore construction that enable an entity to operate multiple nodes that sync to the same state across one another, enabling the owning entity to secure, manage, and transact their data with others without reliance on location or provider-specific infrastructure, interfaces, or routing mechanisms."
