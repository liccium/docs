Introducing Liccium Trust Engine – the next generation rights and media asset management for the web3. With Liccium, content creators can **digitally sign their original creative works** to increase trust in claims and attribution.

By using the service, creators and rightsholders can generate, manage, and declare content-derived identifiers for digital media content on public blockchain networks like Ethereum and Polygon.

With Liccium, content creators can inseparably bind metadata, rights, licences, and other claims to the digital fingerprint of their content and generate and verify credentials and content certificates.

Additionally, Liccium allows users to discover, identify, and verify the authenticity and integrity of digital media content, NFTs, metadata, rights, and licences.

Liccium is not yet another minting and timestamping service; it’s a trust and search engine for verifiable metadata, rights, credentials, and attribution for digital media content.
