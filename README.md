Introducing Liccium Trust Engine – the next generation rights and media asset management for the decentralised web.&#x20;

### Verifiable declarations

With Liccium, content creators and rightsholders can digitally sign their original creative works and make publicly verifiable declarations of their original content.

Liccium helps creators and rightsholders to generate, manage, and declare content-derived identifiers for digital media content.&#x20;

They can inseparably bind verifiable claims – e.g. rights, license, and other product metadata – to the fingerprint of their digital content.&#x20;

All declarations are automatically accessible via decentralised content registries, which allow users or machines to discover, identify, and verify the authenticity and integrity of digital media content and resolve rights, licenses, and other product metadata.

### International Standard Content Code (ISCC)

Using a novel standard for decentralised content identification (ISCC), these claims inseparably stick with the content without relying on watermarks or embedded metadata.&#x20;

ISCC stands as a forthcoming ISO identifier standard and lightweight fingerprinting system designed for all media types and file formats, using cryptographic and similarity- preserving hashes to create a unique ID for each digital asset.

This empowers any user, system, or machine with access to the digital asset to independently generate an identical or similar ISCC code, enabling the identification, comparison, and matching of digital content while assessing its integrity and authenticity.&#x20;

ISCC remains dependable, retaining its full range of capabilities even in scenarios where content is altered or manipulated, or when watermarks, steganographic data, or metadata is removed from the media asset.

### Creator attribution

Digital signatures and verifiable creator credentials increase trust in assertions, claims and the authenticity of the original content and help to sufficiently identify creators and rightsholders.
