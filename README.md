## The Invention of Trust for Digital Media

Introducing Liccium – a highly innovative, novel application that is deploying state-of-the art technology based on cryptographic premises to invent trust and transparency in the digital media space.

With Liccium, content creators and rightsholders can digitally sign their original creative works and make publicly verifiable declarations of their original content. Verifiable declarations of original content create trust in claims, attribution and the authenticity of content.

Soft-binding rights, metadata, and verifiable credentials to content-derived identifiers (ISCC fingerprints), Liccium establishes a persistent and verifiable link between claims and digital content without relying on watermarks or embedded metadata.

All declarations are automatically accessible via federated content registries, which allow users or machines to discover, identify, and verify the authenticity and integrity of digital media content and resolve rights, licenses, and other product metadata.
