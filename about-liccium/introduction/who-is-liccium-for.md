# Who is Liccium for?

Liccium is designed for individual content creators, media organisations, digital platforms, and everyday users who require a reliable system for content authentication, rights management, and provenance tracking.

### Individual Content Creators

Artists, photographers, writers, musicians, and other content creators use the Liccium Cloud Application to digitally sign their original works, publicly declare ownership, metadata, and rights, and protect their intellectual property. Using Liccium’s ISCC-based content fingerprinting and soft-binding technology, creators ensure that their works remain verifiably linked to their claims, even when content is modified or metadata is removed.

### Media Organisations

Publishing houses, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media entities integrate Liccium into their existing workflows to authenticate digital content, manage rights declarations, and maintain verifiable provenance records at scale. Liccium’s software streamlines the management of digital rights, ensuring authenticity, accurate attribution, and transparency across various distribution channels.

### Digital Platforms and AI Providers

Online platforms, content aggregators, and AI developers access Liccium’s federated registries and machine-readable rights declarations to ensure compliance and responsible use of digital media. Liccium helps platforms verify licensing terms, respect AI opt-out declarations, and distinguish clearly between public domain, licensed, and restricted content.

### Internet Users

Internet users can benefit from Liccium by easily verifying the authenticity and provenance of digital media content. Liccium enables them to independently confirm whether content is original or synthetic, accurately determine ownership and licensing status, and protect themselves from misinformation, manipulated media, or unauthorised use of copyrighted works.
