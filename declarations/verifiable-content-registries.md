# Verifiable content registries

Creators and rightsholders can generate ISCC codes from their content and publicly declare the codes to open and federated verifiable content registries, another technology implemented by Liccium for this use case. With this declaration, they can persistently and inextricably bind product information, rights and licenses, provenance and other metadata or claims to the unique identifier of the media asset – and ‘persistently’ means: the data cannot be removed! But how does this work? Instead of embedding information, watermarks and steganographic data in the file itself, the selected metadata is externalized, i.e. hashed, published and bound as a sidecar file to an ISCC code of the file derived from the content.&#x20;

Once declared, federated registries can serve as platforms to discover ISCC codes and resolve associated declaration metadata. Through these registries, creators and rightsholders can publicly disclose their intellectual property rights and content metadata, ensuring that this information is accessible and verifiable. This enables a transparent system in which the authenticity and originality of digital content can be easily verified or fake and AI generated content can be identified, enhancing trust and simplifying the process of copyright compliance for all parties involved.
