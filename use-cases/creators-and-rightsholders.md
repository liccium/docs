# Creators & Rightsholders

* **Publicly Declare Ownership:**\
  Establish verifiable, persistent claims regarding ownership, copyright status, licensing terms, and metadata.
* **Protect Intellectual Property:**\
  Clearly communicate AI opt-out reservations and rightsholder preferences, reducing unauthorized content use and supporting fair remuneration.
* **Persistent Attribution and Verification:**
* Ensure that creative works remain securely attributed to creators across different platforms, supporting ongoing content authenticity.
