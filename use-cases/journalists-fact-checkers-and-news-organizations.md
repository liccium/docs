# Journalists, Fact-Checkers & News Organizations

Liccium supports journalists, media organizations, and fact-checkers by providing tools for rapid, reliable verification of digital content, significantly enhancing transparency, accuracy, and public trust.

With Liccium, journalists and media professionals can:

* **Instantly Verify Content Authenticity:**\
  Quickly cross-check digital content—including images, videos, audio files, and articles—against rights declarations and metadata stored in federated registries. This enables immediate detection of manipulated, synthetic, or misattributed media, proactively combating misinformation.
* **Flag and Publicly Declare Manipulated or Synthetic Media:**\
  Efficiently identify and flag manipulated or synthetic digital content. Journalists and news organizations can publicly declare these findings within Liccium’s federated registries, enabling other platforms, media organizations, and users to independently verify or challenge content authenticity.
* **Publish Verifiable Content Declarations:**\
  Make digital media declarations publicly accessible through Liccium’s federated registries, providing authoritative, cryptographically secured metadata linked to ISCC fingerprints. Liccium's approach is fully interoperable and compatible with industry standards such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), ensuring transparency and accountability in content verification across the media landscape.
