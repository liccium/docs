# AI Model Providers & Digital Platforms

Liccium helps digital platforms and AI providers meet the growing regulatory requirements around AI-generated content and responsible usage of training data. By providing structured and verifiable metadata and rights declarations, Liccium enables compliance with frameworks such as the EU Copyright Directive and the EU AI Act, which require respect of rightsholders' preferences and transparency in AI training data and clear identification of AI-generated content.

Liccium enables digital platforms and AI providers to:

### Verify Rights Declarations and Permission

Efficiently reference rights declarations stored in federated registries, ensuring AI training datasets align precisely with rightsholders' explicitly expressed licensing conditions, opt-out declarations, or usage restrictions. This enables platforms and AI providers to either properly license content or exclude restricted assets from training data, ensuring compliance and reducing legal risk.

### Provide Transparency about AI Training Data

Comply with transparency requirements of the EU AI Act by using Liccium’s federated registries to generate comprehensive, cryptographically verifiable summaries of digital content used in AI model training.

### Clearly Flag AI-generated Content

Use Liccium to clearly identify and flag AI-generated outputs – such as synthetic images, audio, video, or text – reducing risks of misinformation and strengthening public trust and accountability in digital media.
