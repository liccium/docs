# Liccium Services and Pricing

Liccium provides robust, standards-based services for both individual creators and enterprise clients, enabling verifiable rights declarations, metadata integrity verification, and content provenance disclosure across all digital media types. While the underlying protocols such as ISCC (ISO 24138:2024) and TDM·AI are free and open to use, Liccium offers optional commercial services to make these declarations actionable, persistent, and scalable.

## For Individual Creators (B2C)

The **Liccium Cloud App** is designed for creators and rightsholders who want to protect and assert their rights in the AI era. Whether you're a photographer, writer, musician, or video creator, the app allows you to:

* Generate ISCC codes and link them to rights declarations and AI opt-out preferences
* Digitally sign and timestamp your content claims
* Publish metadata to federated public registries
* Access content-specific plugins to provide sector-specific metadata for photos (IPTC), books (ONIX), music (ISRC), and more

Liccium offers a **tiered subscription model**:

* A **free plan** with essential features and a limited number of declarations
* **Paid plans** that scale with your needs, including higher storage, plugin access, and priority support
* **Professional plans** for studios or agencies managing large portfolios

Additional declaration packages or storage upgrades can be added on demand, ensuring flexible, predictable pricing for all types of creators.

## For Media Organizations (B2B)

Liccium supports publishers, platforms, libraries, and other institutions with scalable infrastructure and enterprise-grade tools. The **Liccium Declaration Engine** is a customisable on-premise solution that enables:

* Generation of ISCC codes
* Bulk ingestion of content and metadata
* Integration with internal CMS or asset management systems
* API-based access to the federated registry infrastructure

Commercial B2B services follow a **modular pricing model**:

* A one-time setup and onboarding fee (if necessary)
* Ongoing monthly service tiers, which include content hosting, registry access through APIs and other means, and technical support
* Volume-based tiers for large-scale content declarations and hosting of declarations
* Optional development services for workflow customisation and integration

This pricing structure ensures transparency and scalability while supporting compliance with emerging AI and copyright regulations.

## Registry Infrastructure Services

Liccium also operates and maintains a **federated registry infrastructure** – a distributed, peer-to-peer network that ensures high availability, auditability, and verifiability of declarations. This infrastructure is used by both B2C and B2B clients and enables discovery of rights and metadata, including creator credentials.

Developer tools such as Docker images and full API documentation are available to support in-house development and self-integration.

## No Licensing Fees for Protocols

It is important to note that:

* **ISCC** (ISO 24138) is an open and free-to-use standard for digital content identification.
* **TDM·AI** is a non-proprietary protocol for declaring usage preferences, developed under open governance.

Liccium charges **no licensing fees** for use of these protocols. Our commercial offerings cover infrastructure, hosting, support, integrations, and registry operations.
